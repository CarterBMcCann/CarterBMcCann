            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a college student studying computer sciences hoping to get into programming professionally. I plan to have my certificate by the end of the next semester in 2025. I don't have much in the way of relevant work experience but my time working in quality assurance has been a great help to note taking and parsing important details from less pressing ones. In my free time I like to play TTRPGS and Warhammer. I have been a Dungeon Master consistently for about 4 years and painting models for 3.</p>
